# beacon
A [BLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy) dynamic label that can be configured with [web bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/) to display custom graphics, text, and status color.

By connecting to one of many parent bluetooth hubs throughout a warehouse or production facility, and combined with signal strength metrics and training data, label position may be estimated.  When affixed to an in-work assembly, time and position may be used to determine manufacturing process (paint, assembly, testing, etc), for example.
